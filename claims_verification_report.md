## Missing Claims Summary:

### Missing Brand Claims:
1. Work with best farms for dairy
2. Luxurious (texture)
3. Melts slowly in your mouth
4. Dense, low-air ice cream
5. Driven to be the world's best Ice cream
6. Founded by the Mattus family
7. Carefully crafted
8. Crafted by expert chefs
9. Driven for perfection

### Missing Product-Specific Claims:
1. Compound Usage claim
2. Dark Chocolate Coating (Sticks) - specific claim
3. Many product-specific No Emulsifiers/No Colours/No Stabilisers claims for individual SKUs

### Additional Observations:
1. Many SKU-specific claims from the product sheet are not individually mapped in the database
2. The database appears to use a more generalized approach rather than SKU-by-SKU mapping
3. Some claims that vary by SKU (like "No Emulsifiers" which is NO for some products and YES for others) need more granular product associations

## Recommendations:
1. Add missing brand-level claims
2. Create more specific product associations for claims that vary by SKU
3. Add missing texture and craftsmanship claims
4. Consider adding SKU-level claim mapping for more accurate representation
