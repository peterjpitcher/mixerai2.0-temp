# Migration Summary - 2025-07-04

## What We've Done

### 1. **Cleaned Up Migration Files**
- Moved migrations from "Already Applied" folder back to main folder
- Renamed all migrations to follow consistent format: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`
- Removed duplicate and unnecessary migrations
- Created placeholder files for remote-only migrations to sync history

### 2. **Created Complete Production Schema**
We've created a comprehensive set of migrations based on the actual production database:

#### **20250104100000_complete_production_schema.sql**
- Contains all 39 tables with proper foreign key ordering
- Includes all constraints, defaults, and column definitions
- Adds missing columns identified in previous migrations:
  - Batch support for `tool_run_history`
  - Email preferences for `profiles`
  - Last admin check for `user_brands`
  - Global blocking support for `master_claim_brands`

#### **20250104100001_complete_production_functions.sql**
- Contains all 53 functions from production
- Includes all triggers and trigger functions
- Contains all 97 Row Level Security policies
- Includes all views and grants
- Fixed function references from `brand_master_claims` to `master_claim_brands`

#### **20250104100002_concurrent_indexes.sql**
- Contains indexes that must be created with CONCURRENTLY
- Includes performance and text search indexes
- Must be run separately after main migrations

### 3. **Fixed Key Issues**
- Corrected table name references (master_claim_brands vs brand_master_claims)
- Added missing RLS SELECT policies for tables with INSERT policies
- Included all fixes from previous individual migrations
- Proper dependency ordering for foreign keys

## How to Apply

1. **Test the migrations** (dry run):
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push --include-all --dry-run
   ```

2. **Apply the main migrations**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push --include-all
   ```

3. **Apply concurrent indexes separately**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db execute --file supabase/migrations/20250104100002_concurrent_indexes.sql
   ```

## Important Notes

- These migrations create the complete schema from scratch
- They include all production tables, functions, policies, and indexes
- The migrations are idempotent where possible (using IF NOT EXISTS)
- Concurrent indexes must be run separately as they cannot be in a transaction
- All previous migration fixes have been incorporated

## Migration Files

1. `20250616194957_remote_migration.sql` - Placeholder for remote migration
2. `20250616202303_remote_migration.sql` - Placeholder for remote migration
3. `20250616202721_remote_migration.sql` - Placeholder for remote migration
4. `20250104100000_complete_production_schema.sql` - Complete table schema
5. `20250104100001_complete_production_functions.sql` - Functions, triggers, policies
