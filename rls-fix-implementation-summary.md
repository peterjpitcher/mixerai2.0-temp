# RLS Fix Implementation Summary

## Issue Fixed
GitHub Issue #213: "new row violates row-level security policy" errors during INSERT operations

## Root Cause
Supabase INSERT operations return the inserted row by default, which triggers a SELECT operation. When tables have INSERT policies but lack corresponding SELECT policies, the operation fails with an RLS violation error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Migration Created
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250701_fix_rls_insert_select_policies.sql`

This migration adds missing SELECT policies for tables that perform INSERT operations:
- `brand_master_claim_brands`
- `tool_run_history`
- `content_versions`
- `user_tasks`
- `workflow_invitations`
- `notifications`
- `claim_reviews`
- `market_claim_overrides`

Each SELECT policy matches the permissions of its corresponding INSERT policy.

### 2. RLS Helper Functions Created
**File**: `src/lib/api/rls-helpers.ts`

Created comprehensive RLS utilities:
- `isRLSError()` - Detects RLS policy violations
- `handleRLSError()` - Provides consistent error handling
- `validateRLSFields()` - Pre-validates required fields
- `preValidateRLSPermission()` - Checks permissions before DB operations
- `RLS_SAFE_OPTIONS` - Common options for RLS-safe operations

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
**File**: `src/lib/api-utils.ts`

Updated `handleApiError()` to:
- Detect RLS violations specifically
- Return user-friendly error messages
- Log detailed information for debugging
- Return 403 Forbidden status for permission errors

### 4. Fixed TypeScript Issues
- Fixed type error in `src/components/dashboard/my-tasks.tsx`
- Fixed comparison error in `src/lib/api/rls-helpers.ts`

## Testing Performed
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint checks pass (existing unrelated warnings remain)
- ✅ Production build completes successfully
- ✅ All API routes compile without errors

## Next Steps

### To Deploy the Fix:
1. Run the migration in your Supabase project:
   ```bash
   supabase migration up
   ```

2. Monitor for RLS errors using the new error handling:
   - Check logs for `[RLS Policy Violation]` entries
   - Track which tables/operations fail most

3. For any remaining RLS issues:
   - Use `validateRLSFields()` before inserts
   - Consider using admin client for system operations
   - Add more specific SELECT policies as needed

### Best Practices Going Forward:
1. **Always create policy pairs**: When adding INSERT policies, add matching SELECT policies
2. **Use admin client for system operations**: Tool logging, notifications, etc.
3. **Pre-validate permissions**: Check user permissions before attempting DB operations
4. **Log RLS violations**: Track patterns to identify systemic issues

## Files Modified
- `/supabase/migrations/20250701_fix_rls_insert_select_policies.sql` (new)
- `/src/lib/api/rls-helpers.ts` (new)
- `/src/lib/api-utils.ts` (updated)
- `/src/components/dashboard/my-tasks.tsx` (fixed)

## Conclusion
The RLS violation issue has been comprehensively addressed through:
1. Database-level fixes (missing SELECT policies)
2. Application-level helpers (validation and error handling)
3. Improved error messages for better debugging

The solution is backward compatible and doesn't require changes to existing INSERT operations, as the fix is at the policy level.
