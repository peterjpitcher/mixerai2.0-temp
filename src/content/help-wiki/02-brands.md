## Setting Up Your Brand Profile

### What should I include in Brand Identity?

Write 2-3 sentences about:
- What your company does
- Your mission or values  
- What makes you different

Example: "We create eco-friendly cleaning products for health-conscious families. Our mission is to make non-toxic cleaning accessible and affordable. We believe clean homes shouldn't come at the cost of our planet."

### What should I include in Tone of Voice?

Describe how your brand communicates:
- Personality traits (friendly, professional, playful)
- Writing style (formal, conversational, technical)
- Things to avoid (jargon, negative language)

Example: "Friendly and approachable, like talking to a knowledgeable neighbor. Use simple language, avoid chemical jargon. Be encouraging and positive."

### What are Guardrails?

Guardrails are specific rules for your content:
- **Always mention**: Key messages or features
- **Never mention**: Competitors or sensitive topics
- **Required disclaimers**: Legal or compliance text

Example: "Always mention our 30-day guarantee. Never compare to competitors by name. Include 'Safe for pets and children' when relevant."

### How do I define Target Audience?

Describe who you're writing for:
- Demographics (age, location)
- Interests and values
- Problems they're trying to solve

Example: "Parents aged 25-45 who care about their family's health and the environment. They want effective cleaning without harsh chemicals."

## Troubleshooting

### Why isn't the AI using my brand voice?

1. Check that you've selected the correct brand
2. Review your Tone of Voice section - add more specific examples
3. Make sure Guardrails are clear and specific
4. Try regenerating the content

### Can I have multiple brands?

Yes! You can create as many brands as needed. Users will see only the brands they have permission to access.

### How do I delete a brand?

Contact your administrator. Deleting brands affects all associated content, so this requires admin privileges.
