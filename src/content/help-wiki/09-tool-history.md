# Tool Run History

Tool History keeps a record of all AI tool usage, allowing you to view past results and track what's been created.

## Viewing History

### Where do I find tool history?

Tool history is accessible in two ways:
1. Within each tool page - look for the **Recent Runs** section at the bottom
2. Click on any history entry to view full details

### What information is shown?

For each tool run:
- **Date & Time** - When the tool was used
- **Status** - Success or failure
- **Inputs** - What you provided
- **Outputs** - What was generated
- **View Details** - Link to see complete information

   - Formatted results

### Can I reuse previous results?

Yes! When viewing details:
1. Use the **Copy** buttons to copy specific outputs
