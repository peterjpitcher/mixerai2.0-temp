# Reporting Issues

Help us improve MixerAI by reporting bugs or requesting features through our GitHub integration.

## How It Works

MixerAI uses GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and questions. Only administrators can view and manage issues.

## For Administrators

### Viewing Issues

1. Click **Issues** in the left navigation (admin only)
2. You'll see all open GitHub issues for the project
3. Issues are organized by priority labels
4. Click any issue to view details on GitHub

### Issue Management

The Issues page shows:
- Issue title and description
- Priority labels (High, Medium, Low)
- Creation date
- Number of comments
- Link to view on GitHub

### Creating Issues

Issues must be created directly on GitHub. The Issues page in MixerAI is read-only.

## For All Users

### How to Report Problems

If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion:

1. Contact your administrator
2. Provide detailed information:
   - What you were trying to do
   - What went wrong
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Screenshots if helpful
3. Your admin will create a GitHub issue

### What to Include

**For bugs:**
- Specific error messages
- Browser and operating system
- Time and date of occurrence
- What you expected to happen

**For feature requests:**
- What you want to accomplish
- Why it would be helpful
- Who would benefit

## Note

The Issues feature is only visible to platform administrators. All other users should report problems through their admin or team lead.
