# Creating and Managing Content

Content is any marketing material you create in MixerAI - from social posts to blog articles. The AI helps you generate content that matches your brand voice and includes the right product information.

## Creating Content

### How do I create new content?

1. Click **Content** in the left navigation
2. Click **All Content** to see existing content
3. To create new content, you must select a template from the **Create Content** submenu
4. Choose a template (e.g., "Blog Post", "Social Media")
5. This takes you to the content generator

### How does the content generator work?

1. **Select a Brand** - Choose from the dropdown (only compatible brands show)
2. **Fill Template Fields** - Complete all required fields (marked with *)
3. **Generate Content**:
   - Use **Suggest** buttons (sparkle icon ✨) for individual fields
   - Or click **Generate Content & Title** to generate everything at once
4. Review and edit the generated content
5. Click **Save Content** when ready

### What are template fields?

Each template has specific fields like:
- **Short Text** - Single line inputs
- **Long Text** - Multi-line text areas  
- **Select** - Dropdown options
- **Product Selector** - Choose products to include
- **Rich Text** - Formatted content with styling

### How do I select products?

If your template has a Product Selector field:
1. Click the product selector dropdown
2. Search or browse available products
3. Select the products you want
4. Product claims are automatically included when you generate content

### Important Notes

- All required fields must be filled before generating

## Managing Existing Content
