# Working with Product Claims

Claims are approved statements about your products that can be used in marketing content. MixerAI ensures you only use verified claims that meet regulatory requirements.

## Using Claims in Content

### How do claims work in my content?

1. When you select products in a template, their claims are automatically included
2. The AI uses these claims when generating content
3. Claims appear formatted according to your brand guidelines
4. You cannot edit claim text directly (for compliance reasons)

### How do I see what claims a product has?

1. Click **Claims** → **Products** in navigation
2. Find your product in the list
3. Click on the product name
4. View all associated claims

### What if I need different claim wording?

Contact your admin or legal team. Claims must be approved before use. They can:
- Create brand-specific versions
- Add market-specific overrides
- Update claim language

### Why can't I edit claim text in my content?

Claims are legally approved text that cannot be modified to ensure compliance. If you need different wording, request a new claim version through proper channels.

### How do I know which claims to use?

- Your template may preselect products with claims
- The AI automatically includes relevant claims
- Check with your brand manager for guidance

### What's the difference between product and ingredient claims?

- **Product claims**: Specific to that product
- **Ingredient claims**: Apply to all products with that ingredient

Both types are included when you select a product.

## Best Practices

- Always verify claims are current before using
- Don't paraphrase claims in your content
- Let the AI handle claim integration
- Report any claim issues to your admin
