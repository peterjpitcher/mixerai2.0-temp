# Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is your mission control in MixerAI, presenting a carefully curated view of what matters most. Rather than overwhelming you with data, it focuses on actionable insights and immediate priorities, helping you start each session productively.

## Dashboard Layout

### The Welcome Experience

When you arrive at your dashboard, you're greeted personally—"Welcome back" appears at the top, followed by your name if you've completed your profile setup. This isn't just a nicety; it confirms you're logged into the correct account and sets a professional, personalised tone for your work session.

Immediately below the welcome message, you'll see a subtitle: "Here's what's happening with your content today." This contextual message reminds you that the dashboard is dynamic, reflecting real-time activity rather than static information.

### Understanding the Grid Layout

The dashboard employs a sophisticated grid system that adapts to your screen size. On desktop displays, content is arranged in a three-quarter/one-quarter split. The left side (taking up three columns) contains your primary work areas—tasks and aged content. The right side (one column) displays the team activity feed in a condensed format.

This layout isn't arbitrary. User research shows that most people scan from left to right, so your most actionable items—tasks requiring your attention—appear in the primary viewing area. The activity feed on the right provides ambient awareness of team activity without demanding immediate attention.

On mobile devices or smaller screens, this layout intelligently reflows to a single column, maintaining the priority order: tasks first, aged content second, and activity feed last. This responsive design ensures you can manage your work effectively regardless of device.

## My Tasks Section

### More Than a To-Do List

The My Tasks component is arguably the most important element of your dashboard. Unlike a simple to-do list, it's an intelligent task management system that understands context, deadlines, and dependencies. Tasks aren't just items you've created for yourself—they're generated automatically when content enters workflows requiring your review, when colleagues assign you work, or when system events need your attention.

The section displays several key metrics at the top. You'll see your total pending tasks, giving you an immediate sense of workload. Next to this, completed tasks from the past week are shown, providing a sense of progress and accomplishment. This psychological element is important—seeing completed work motivates continued productivity.

### Task Organisation and Priority

Tasks are organised intelligently, not just chronologically. The system considers multiple factors when ordering tasks:

**Due dates** naturally take precedence—urgent items appear first. However, the system is smarter than simple date sorting. It understands business hours and weekends, so a task due Monday morning might appear above one due Sunday evening if your organisation doesn't work weekends.

**Workflow dependencies** also influence ordering. If a piece of content is stalled waiting for your review, and others are waiting downstream, that task gains priority. The system understands that your delay might be blocking multiple team members.

**Task type** provides another layer of organisation. Reviews and approvals typically appear before general tasks, as they often have stricter SLAs (Service Level Agreements) and impact others' work more directly.

### Interacting with Tasks

Each task in your list shows essential information without overwhelming detail. You'll see the task title, which clearly states what needs doing: "Review article: Q4 Marketing Strategy" or "Approve content: Product Launch Announcement". The related content or workflow is linked, allowing one-click navigation to the work itself.

The age of each task is displayed subtly—recent tasks might just show "2 hours ago" whilst older ones display specific dates. This temporal context helps you understand not just what needs doing, but how long it's been waiting.

When you click on a task, you're taken directly to the relevant action point. If it's a content review, you'll arrive at the content with review tools ready. If it's a workflow approval, you'll see the approval interface. This direct routing eliminates the frustration of clicking a task only to hunt for what actually needs doing.

## Most Aged Content

### Identifying Bottlenecks

The Most Aged Content section, positioned below your tasks, serves as an early warning system for content that might be stuck or forgotten. This isn't about shaming procrastination—it's about surfacing potential problems before they become critical.

The section displays up to five content items that have been in draft or pending review status for the longest time. Each item is presented as a card showing the content title, its current status, the brand it belongs to (with the brand's colour as a visual indicator), and crucially, when it was last updated.

### Understanding Content Ageing

Content can age for various legitimate reasons. Perhaps it's a long-term project that's genuinely in progress. Maybe it's waiting for external input or approval. Or it could be seasonal content prepared well in advance. The dashboard doesn't judge—it simply presents information for you to act upon.

What makes this feature valuable is its ability to prevent content from being completely forgotten. In busy content operations, it's easy for pieces to slip through the cracks, especially if they don't have firm deadlines. By surfacing aged content on the dashboard, MixerAI ensures everything gets periodic attention.

The brand colour coding is particularly helpful if you work across multiple brands. At a glance, you can see if aged content is concentrated in one brand (perhaps indicating a process issue) or distributed across several (suggesting a broader workflow challenge).

### Taking Action on Aged Content

Each aged content item is clickable, taking you directly to the content details page. From there, you can assess why it's stalled and take appropriate action. Perhaps it needs a gentle nudge to the reviewer, or maybe requirements have changed and it needs updating before proceeding.

The beauty of this system is its subtlety. Rather than sending nagging notifications about old content, it simply makes the information visible. This respects your autonomy whilst ensuring nothing is truly forgotten.

## Team Activity Feed

### Ambient Awareness

The Team Activity Feed occupies the right column of your dashboard, designed to be glanceable rather than demanding. This is ambient information—awareness of what's happening around you without the need for immediate action.

The feed shows real-time activity from team members working on brands you have access to. Each entry includes a small profile picture (or initials if no picture is set), the person's name, their action, and when it occurred. Actions might include creating new content, updating existing pieces, completing reviews, or publishing content.

### The Value of Transparency

This transparency serves multiple purposes. First, it prevents duplicate work—if you see a colleague just created content about a specific topic, you know not to create something similar. Second, it facilitates collaboration—seeing someone working on related content might prompt you to share resources or coordinate efforts.

The feed also provides a sense of team momentum. On busy days, seeing the constant flow of activity can be energising. On quieter days, it might prompt you to contribute. This social element of work is often undervalued in remote or distributed teams, but it's crucial for maintaining engagement and connection.

### Condensed vs Full View

On the dashboard, the activity feed appears in a condensed format, showing perhaps 10-15 recent items without timestamps taking up too much space. This condensed view prioritises recency and relevance over complete information.

If you need more detail, clicking "View All Activity" (or similar) takes you to a full activity log with filtering options, search capabilities, and extended history. This layered approach gives you quick awareness on the dashboard whilst providing deep investigation tools when needed.

## Navigation Elements

### The Sidebar

The left sidebar is your primary navigation tool in MixerAI. It remains consistent across all dashboard pages, providing stable wayfinding regardless of where you are in the application. The sidebar uses a combination of icons and text labels, ensuring both quick recognition for frequent users and clarity for newcomers.

The navigation is organised logically, with the most frequently used items at the top:
- **Dashboard** (where you are now)
- **Content** for content management
- **Brands** for brand configuration
- **Claims** for regulatory compliance
- **Templates** for content templates
- **Workflows** for approval processes
- **Tools** for AI-powered utilities

Below these primary functions, you'll find personal items like "My Tasks" and administrative functions like "Users" (if you have appropriate permissions).

### The Header Bar

Above your main content area, the header bar provides account-level functions and global tools. On the right side, you'll find your profile menu, accessed by clicking your avatar or initials. This menu includes profile settings, account preferences, and the sign-out option.

The header may also include notification indicators, showing unread notifications or alerts requiring attention. These notifications are separate from tasks—they might include system announcements, workflow completions, or security alerts.

### Breadcrumb Navigation

While not visible on the dashboard itself (as it's the top level), breadcrumb navigation appears on all subsidiary pages. This shows your current location in the site hierarchy and allows quick navigation back up the tree. For example, when viewing a specific content item, breadcrumbs might show: Dashboard > Content > Article Title.

## Customising Your View

### Personal Preferences

While MixerAI's dashboard isn't infinitely customisable (to maintain consistency across teams), certain preferences can be adjusted to suit your working style. These preferences are typically found in your account settings rather than on the dashboard itself.

You might be able to adjust:
- **Time zone** for task deadlines and activity timestamps
- **Date format** (DD/MM/YYYY vs MM/DD/YYYY)
- **First day of week** for calendar views
- **Notification preferences** for various event types

### Responsive to Your Role

The dashboard intelligently adapts based on your role and permissions. Administrators see additional metrics and system health indicators. Editors might see more content-focused widgets. Viewers get a simplified interface focused on consumption rather than creation.

This role-based adaptation happens automatically—you don't need to configure it. The system knows your permissions and presents the most relevant interface for your needs.

## Dashboard Best Practices

### Morning Routine

Successful MixerAI users often develop a morning routine around their dashboard. Start by reviewing your tasks—what's urgent today? What's been waiting longest? Clear any quick tasks immediately to build momentum.

Next, scan the aged content. Anything there that surprises you? Perhaps a piece you thought was completed or something you'd forgotten about entirely. Make notes about what needs attention.

Finally, glance at the activity feed. Has overnight work from other time zones created anything you need to respond to? Are colleagues working on projects that might affect your plans for the day?

This routine need not take more than five minutes, but it ensures you start each day informed and intentional rather than reactive.

### Throughout the Day

The dashboard isn't just for morning check-ins. Return to it periodically throughout the day. Tasks update in real-time, so new assignments appear as they're created. The activity feed continues scrolling, keeping you aware of team progress.

Consider keeping the dashboard open in a browser tab, even when working elsewhere in MixerAI. Modern browsers are intelligent about resource usage, so an idle tab won't impact performance, but you can quickly switch back to check for updates.

### End of Day Review

Before signing off, a final dashboard check ensures nothing urgent has arrived late in the day. Review tomorrow's tasks to mentally prepare. Check if any aged content needs escalation before another day passes.

This end-of-day review also provides closure—seeing your completed tasks from the week reminds you of progress made, while tomorrow's tasks are noted but not yet demanding attention.

## Mobile Considerations

### Dashboard on the Go

MixerAI's dashboard is fully responsive, working effectively on tablets and smartphones. However, the mobile experience is optimised for quick checks rather than extended work sessions.

On mobile, the grid layout collapses to a single column. Priority is maintained—tasks appear first, aged content second, activity feed last. Touch targets are enlarged for finger-friendly interaction, and swipe gestures may be available for quick actions like marking tasks complete.

The mobile dashboard is ideal for staying informed whilst away from your desk. Check tasks during your commute, review activity during breaks, or quickly approve urgent content from your phone. For detailed work, though, the desktop experience remains superior.

## Performance and Loading

### Optimised for Speed

The dashboard is engineered to load quickly, even with substantial data. It uses intelligent loading strategies—critical information appears immediately whilst secondary data loads in the background. You'll notice tasks appear almost instantly, whilst the activity feed might populate a moment later.

This progressive loading ensures you can start working immediately rather than staring at loading spinners. The system also caches certain data locally, so returning to the dashboard after navigating elsewhere is nearly instantaneous.

### Real-time Updates

Once loaded, the dashboard maintains a real-time connection to the server (where supported). This means new tasks appear without refreshing, the activity feed updates continuously, and aged content metrics adjust as content progresses.

This real-time behaviour makes the dashboard feel alive and current. You're not looking at a snapshot from when you logged in—you're seeing the current state of your content operation.

## Troubleshooting Dashboard Issues

### Common Challenges

If your dashboard seems empty or incorrect, first verify you're logged into the correct account. Multiple accounts (perhaps a personal and work account) can cause confusion. Check the profile menu to confirm your identity.

If tasks aren't appearing, ensure you have the correct brand permissions. Tasks are brand-specific, so if you've recently changed roles or had permissions adjusted, your task list will reflect these changes.

Should the dashboard load slowly or incompletely, try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows, Cmd+Shift+R on Mac). This clears cached data and forces a complete reload. If problems persist, check your internet connection and browser console for error messages.

### Getting Support

The dashboard is the most frequently accessed page in MixerAI, so it's extensively tested and reliable. However, if you encounter persistent issues, use the Issue Reporter (accessible via the support icon) to alert the development team. Include details about what you're seeing (or not seeing) and what you expected to see.

## Conclusion

Your dashboard is more than a landing page—it's a thoughtfully designed workspace that respects your time and attention. By presenting the right information at the right level of detail, it helps you work efficiently without overwhelming you with data.

Master your dashboard routine, and you'll find MixerAI becomes not just a tool you use, but an intelligent assistant that helps you manage complex content operations with confidence and clarity.
