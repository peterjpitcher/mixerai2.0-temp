# Managing Your Tasks

My Tasks shows content assigned to you that needs review or approval.

## Viewing Your Tasks

### How do I see what I need to do?

1. Click **My Tasks** in the left navigation
2. You'll see a list of all content assigned to you
3. Each task shows:
   - Content title
   - Brand name
   - Current workflow step
   - Date assigned

### What shows up in My Tasks?

Only content that is:
- Assigned to you in a workflow
- In "draft" or "pending_review" status
- Waiting for your action

## Taking Action on Tasks

### How do I review content?

1. Click on the content title or **Edit Content** button
2. Review the content in the editor
3. You have two options in the workflow:
   - **Approve** - Moves content to the next workflow step
   - **Reject** - Stops the workflow (requires feedback)

### What happens when I approve?

- Content moves to the next step in the workflow
- Next assigned person gets notified
- Content disappears from your tasks

### What happens when I reject?

- You must provide feedback explaining why
- The workflow stops
- Content creator is notified of the rejection

## Important Notes

- You cannot reassign tasks to other users
- You cannot request changes - only approve or reject
- Tasks are automatically assigned based on workflow configuration
- Only users assigned to the current workflow step can take action

## Tips

- Check My Tasks daily
- Review content thoroughly before approving
- Provide clear feedback when rejecting
- Contact the content creator directly if changes are needed before approval
