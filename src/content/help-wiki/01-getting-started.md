## First Login

### Accessing MixerAI

When you first access MixerAI, you'll arrive at the login page. Your organisation will have provided you with login credentials—typically your work email address and a temporary password. The platform uses Supabase authentication, ensuring your data remains secure throughout your session.

To log in successfully:
1. Navigate to your organisation's MixerAI URL
2. Enter your email address (this serves as your username)
3. Type your password carefully—the system is case-sensitive
4. Click "Sign in" or press Enter

If you're having trouble logging in, double-check that you're using the correct email address associated with your account. Password issues can typically be resolved using the "Forgot password?" link, which will send reset instructions to your registered email.

### Setting Up Your Profile

Once you've successfully logged in, you'll want to personalise your workspace. Your profile helps colleagues identify you and facilitates better collaboration across teams. Click on your avatar in the top right corner and select "Profile Settings" to get started.

Take a moment to add your full name and upload a professional photo—this appears next to your comments and in the activity feed, making it easier for team members to recognise your contributions. While optional, adding your job title and a brief bio helps new team members understand your role and expertise.

## Understanding the Dashboard

### Your Command Centre

The dashboard serves as your operational hub, presenting everything you need at a glance. When you log in, you're greeted with a personalised welcome message—"Welcome back" followed by your name if you've completed your profile. This personal touch sets the tone for a workspace that adapts to your needs.

The main dashboard area is divided into strategic sections. On the left, you'll find your primary workspace displaying active tasks and stalled content that needs attention. The right column shows a condensed team activity feed, keeping you informed about what your colleagues are working on without overwhelming you with information.

### Key Dashboard Components

**My Tasks** appears prominently at the top of your workspace. This isn't just a simple to-do list—it's an intelligent task management system that prioritises work based on deadlines, importance, and workflow dependencies. Tasks are automatically assigned based on your role in various workflows, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks. The system tracks both pending tasks and your completed work from the past week, giving you a sense of accomplishment whilst keeping you focused on what's next.

**Most Aged Content** (or "Stalled Content") helps you identify pieces that haven't progressed recently. This section displays up to five content items that have been sitting in draft or pending review status for the longest time. Each item shows when it was last updated, making it easy to spot bottlenecks. Content can stall for various reasons—perhaps it's awaiting review, missing information, or stuck in an approval queue. This visibility helps you quickly identify and address issues before they become problematic.

**Team Activity Feed** provides real-time updates on content creation, edits, and publishing across your assigned brands. This social element of the platform helps maintain transparency and encourages collaboration. The feed shows who created or updated content, complete with their profile pictures and timestamps. In the condensed view on your dashboard, it's designed to be glanceable yet informative, with the full activity history available if you need more detail.

## Creating Your First Content

### Starting Your Content Journey

Creating content in MixerAI is straightforward, but the platform's power lies in how it guides you through brand compliance and quality standards. Let's walk through creating your first piece of content together.

From the dashboard or any page, you can navigate to content creation through the left sidebar. Click on "Content" to see your content library, then look for the "New Content" button. This takes you to the content creation page where your writing journey begins.

### The Creation Process

The content creation page is thoughtfully designed to gather essential information first, then let you focus on writing. You'll start by selecting fundamental attributes:

**Brand Selection** is crucial—each brand in MixerAI has its own voice, guidelines, and approval workflows. The brand you select determines not just styling but also which claims you can make, what terminology to use, and who needs to review your work. If you have access to multiple brands, you'll see them in a dropdown menu.

**Content Type** helps categorise your work. While the specific types available may vary based on your organisation's configuration, common options include articles, blog posts, and product descriptions. Each type may have different required fields and validation rules.

**Title and Description** give your content identity. The title should be clear and descriptive—this is how others will identify your content in lists and searches. The description provides additional context and can help with internal organisation.

### The Writing Experience

The content editor is where MixerAI truly shines. It's not just a text box—it's an intelligent writing environment powered by a rich text editor. As you type, you have access to familiar formatting tools: headings, bold, italic, lists, links, and more. The editor automatically saves your work as you type, with a small indicator showing when changes are saved.

What makes this editor special is its integration with MixerAI's compliance and brand systems. While you write, the platform can validate your content against brand guidelines and regulatory requirements. If your organisation uses the claims management system, the editor will ensure you're only making approved statements about products.

### Saving and Workflows

When you save your content, you have options: save as a draft to continue working later, or submit it directly into a workflow for review. The workflow system is intelligent—based on your content type and brand, it automatically routes your content to the appropriate reviewers.

If you submit content to a workflow, you'll see it move through various stages: perhaps legal review, brand review, and final approval. Each stage has designated reviewers who receive notifications when content needs their attention. You can track progress directly from the content page or through your task list.

## Essential Features

### Content Library

The content library is your searchable repository of all content across your assigned brands. Accessible via the "Content" link in the sidebar, it presents your content in a clean, filterable interface. The library isn't just a list—it's a powerful content management system.

What makes the content library particularly useful is its flexibility. You can filter by brand, content type, status (draft, published, archived), creation date, or author. The search function looks through titles, descriptions, and content bodies, making it easy to find that specific piece you worked on last month.

Each content item in the library shows key information at a glance: title, brand (with its distinctive colour), status, and last modified date. Click on any item to view its full details, edit it, or check its workflow status.

### Brands Management

Brands are central to MixerAI's multi-tenant architecture. If you have appropriate permissions, you can access the Brands section to view and manage brand configurations. Each brand is like a separate workspace with its own content, settings, and team members.

The brands page displays all brands you have access to, showing their logos, colours, and your role within each. Some users might be editors for one brand but only viewers for another—MixerAI handles these permission differences seamlessly.

For brand managers and administrators, the brand configuration pages offer deep customisation: brand colours, logos, voice guidelines, and more. These settings cascade through all content created for that brand, ensuring consistency across your organisation's output.

### Claims System

For organisations in regulated industries (pharmaceuticals, healthcare, food, cosmetics), the claims management system is a critical feature. Accessible through the "Claims" section in the sidebar, this system ensures that any statements made about products are pre-approved and compliant with regulations.

The claims system has several components:
- **Master Claims**: Core approved statements that can be used across products
- **Products**: Items that claims can be associated with
- **Ingredients**: Components that may have their own claims
- **Markets/Overrides**: Regional variations for global organisations

When creating content, the claims system works behind the scenes to validate your statements. If you try to make an unapproved claim, the system will flag it and suggest approved alternatives.

## Using AI Tools

### Available AI Tools

MixerAI integrates three powerful AI tools powered by Azure OpenAI, accessible through the "Tools" section in the sidebar. These tools are designed to enhance your productivity whilst maintaining brand consistency and compliance.

**Alt Text Generator** helps you create descriptive, accessible text for images. This tool is essential for SEO and accessibility compliance. Simply navigate to the tool, upload an image, and the AI analyses it to generate appropriate alt text. You can customise the output for context and brand voice before applying it to your content.

**Metadata Generator** creates SEO-optimised titles and descriptions for your content. It analyses your content to understand key themes and generates metadata that helps your content rank better in search results. The tool provides suggestions that you can edit and refine before applying.

**Content Transcreator** goes beyond simple translation—it adapts your content for different markets whilst preserving intent and brand voice. This sophisticated tool understands cultural nuances and can localise content appropriately for your target audience.

### Working with AI

To get the best results from AI tools, provide clear context about your goals. Each tool has fields where you can specify requirements, target audience, and tone. The more specific your requirements, the better the output.

The platform tracks AI usage through a credit system—each generation consumes credits from your organisation's monthly allocation. You can see your usage history in the Tools section, helping you understand which tools provide the most value for your workflow.

Always review AI-generated content carefully. While these tools are powerful assistants, they work best when combined with human creativity and judgement. Think of them as intelligent assistants that handle routine tasks, freeing you to focus on strategy and creativity.

## Common Tasks

### Finding and Editing Content

When you need to update existing content, start from the Content library. The search function accepts partial matches, so you don't need to remember exact titles. You can also use filters to narrow down results—particularly useful if you work with large content volumes.

Once you've found your content, click on it to view details. The content page shows everything: the full text, metadata, workflow status, and version history. Click "Edit" to make changes. The platform maintains a complete audit trail, tracking who made changes and when.

### Managing Tasks

Your tasks appear in multiple places: the dashboard's My Tasks section and the dedicated "My Tasks" page accessible from the sidebar. Tasks are automatically created when content needs your review or when colleagues assign work to you.

Each task shows what needs doing, which content it relates to, and when it's due. Click on a task to go directly to the relevant content or workflow stage. Once you've completed the required action, the task automatically updates, keeping your list current without manual maintenance.

### Working with Templates

Templates accelerate content creation by providing proven structures you can customise. Access templates through the "Templates" link in the sidebar. Your organisation may have created templates for common content types: blog posts, product descriptions, email campaigns, and more.

To use a template, select it from the library and click "Create from Template". This creates new content pre-populated with the template structure. You then customise it with your specific information whilst maintaining the tested format that works for your brand.

## Getting Help

### Built-in Support

MixerAI includes several help resources directly within the platform. This help section you're reading now is always accessible from the "Help" link in the sidebar. The documentation is contextual—it understands where you are in the platform and can provide relevant guidance.

Throughout the interface, you'll find helpful tooltips. Hover over any icon or button you're unsure about for a quick explanation. These micro-help moments prevent confusion without interrupting your workflow.

### Issue Reporting

If you encounter problems, the Issue Reporter (accessible through the support icon) provides a direct line to the development team. When reporting an issue, the tool captures relevant context: what page you're on, what you were trying to do, and any error messages. This helps the support team resolve issues quickly.

### Best Practices for Success

To make the most of MixerAI:

**Check your dashboard daily**—even if just for a moment. This keeps you aware of new tasks, team activity, and content that needs attention. The dashboard is designed to surface what's most important, so a quick glance keeps you informed.

**Use the workflow system**—don't bypass it. Workflows exist to ensure quality and compliance. While it might seem faster to skip reviews, the workflow system prevents costly mistakes and maintains consistency.

**Leverage AI tools strategically**. They're excellent for first drafts, routine tasks, and overcoming writer's block. But remember, they're tools, not replacements for human creativity and judgement.

**Keep your profile updated**. This might seem minor, but it helps team members identify you and builds trust in collaborative environments. A professional photo and clear role description go a long way.

## Next Steps
