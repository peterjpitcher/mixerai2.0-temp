MixerAI 2.0 gives brand, marketing, legal, and compliance teams a single workspace to move campaign assets from intake through approval without passing source documents between tools. D&T partners with each market (e.g. Blue Buffalo teams in the US, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mexico, Australia, and China) to translate guard rails, tone, product facts, ingredient notes, and creative briefs into MixerAI fields, templates, and multi-step human approval workflows so reviewers always sign off before anything is released.

Structured inputs originate with brand teams and D&T via the dashboard, are stored in Supabase tables secured by RLS/MFA policies, and power Azure OpenAI-assisted drafting for copy, metadata, alt text, and localized variants. Personal data is limited to user profile details (name, email, role metadata, notification preferences) needed for access control, task routing, and audit logging; all content versions, workflow states, agency selections, and AI tool runs are logged to maintain traceability without ingesting original source documents.

Output from MixerAI includes approved campaign kits, accessibility assets, localized content packets, audit trails, and workflow analytics that downstream agency partners and internal stakeholders rely on for activation, compliance reviews, and future planning. Core execution is owned by D&T with contributions from Brand Marketing, Legal/Regulatory, Medical/Claims, and local market teams, while Azure OpenAI, Supabase, Resend (email), and optional Upstash Redis provide the external services in the data flow; periodic reassessments focus on keeping regulator catalogs current, tightening security (latest RLS/AAL2 hardening), and documenting any market-specific changes before the next review cycle.
