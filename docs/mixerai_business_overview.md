# MixerAI in Plain English

MixerAI is a shared workspace that helps marketing, brand, legal, and compliance teams create campaign materials that stay on-message and meet guard rails. Everyone works from the same brand profiles, content templates, and approval workflows so assets move from draft to approval without email trails or spreadsheets.

**What goes in**
- Brand identity details, tone, and compliance rules
- Product facts, guard rails, and ingredient notes
- Channel-specific templates, creative briefs, and structured references (MixerAI does not collect or store source documents)
- Team assignments, approval steps, and local market requirements
- Dedicated approval workflows that D&T co-designs with each brand so a human reviewer signs off on every deliverable

**What comes out**
- AI-assisted drafts for copy blocks, alt text, metadata, and market-ready adaptations
- Structured workflow updates that show who owns the next action and what feedback is outstanding
- Version history, audit logs, and hand-off packets that can be shared with agencies or downstream systems

**Why it matters**
- Keeps every market aligned on the same brand guard rails while allowing for local nuance
- Speeds up regulated reviews by giving legal and medical teams a single source of truth
- Cuts down on manual rework by storing reusable templates and remembering past decisions
- Guarantees human-in-the-loop oversight because MixerAI will not release content without the workflow approvals D&T puts in place

MixerAI replaces the patchwork of documents, email, and point tools with one platform that keeps campaigns compliant and on schedule while ensuring original source documents remain within brand-controlled systems.
