# Role-Based Navigation Permissions Matrix

This document outlines the typical visibility and accessibility of main navigation items for different user roles within the MixerAI application, incorporating brand-specific access rules and conditional access for Admins.

## User Role Definitions

The permissions are based on the following standard role definitions:

*   **Viewer:** Can only view content for brands they are assigned to. They can use available tools. They cannot make any changes to content or manage any platform settings, brands, workflows, templates, or users.
*   **Editor:** Can create and edit content for brands they are assigned to. They can use available tools. They typically cannot manage users, or system-level brand, workflow, or template configurations.
*   **Admin:** 
    *   **If assigned to NO brands (Platform Admin):** Can manage all aspects of the platform, including ALL brands, content, users, workflows, and templates across the entire system.
    *   **If assigned to one or more brands (Scoped Admin):** Can manage users globally. Their view and management capabilities for brands, content, workflows, and templates are restricted to ONLY their assigned brand(s). Within this scope, they retain administrative rights (create, edit, delete).

## Detailed Navigation Visibility Matrix

The following matrix indicates whether a main navigation item is generally visible/accessible ('✓') or hidden/inaccessible ('✗') for each role. 
Symbols used:
*   `*`: Access is filtered based on the user's assigned brands (for Viewers & Editors).
*   `**`: For Admins, access is comprehensive if NO brands are assigned. If ANY brands are assigned, access is filtered to those assigned brands for brand-specific entities (Brands, Content, Workflows, Templates). User management remains global.
*   `†`: For Product Claims: Platform Admins always see this. Viewer, Editor, and Scoped Admin roles, visibility depends on at least one assigned brand having a `master_claim_brand_id`.

### Notes on the Matrix:

*   **Admin Role Conditional Access (`**`):** 
    *   If an Admin has NO brand assignments, they have full platform-wide access to view and manage all Brands, Content, Workflows, and Templates.
    *   If an Admin IS assigned to one or more brands, their access to view and manage Brands, Content, Workflows, and Templates is restricted to ONLY those brands they are assigned to. 
    *   User Management capabilities (viewing users, inviting users) remain global for all Admins, regardless of brand assignments.
*   **Viewer/Editor Brand-Restricted Access (`*`):** For 'Viewer' and 'Editor' roles, any access to content listings, content type categories, or content creation capabilities is strictly limited to the brands they are assigned to. The UI should filter navigation links and content views accordingly.
*   **Product Claims Conditional Access (`†`):** 
    *   **Platform Admins** (Admin role with no brand assignments) always have access to "Product Claims".
    *   **Scoped Admins** (Admin role with brand assignments), **Editors**, and **Viewers** only have access to "Product Claims" if at least one of their assigned brands has an active `master_claim_brand_id`.
*   **Contextual Actions:** Actions like "Edit Brand," "Edit Content," "Edit Workflow," etc., are generally contextual (e.g., an "edit" button on an item's detail page) and not main navigation links.
    *   Viewers: No edit capabilities.
    *   Editors: Can edit content for their assigned brands.
    *   Admins: Full edit capabilities within their scope (platform-wide or brand-specific).
*   **"Content Folder":** This represents navigation to views of specific content types. The available content types and the content within them must be filtered based on brand assignments for Viewers, Editors, and Scoped Admins.

This matrix and role-based navigation view should serve as a guideline. The conditional access for Admins based on brand assignments is a key refinement.
