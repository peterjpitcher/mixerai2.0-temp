# Documentation Archive

Materials in this folder are reference-only. They are either historical initiatives, completed section reviews, or narratives that are not part of the day-to-day engineering handbook. Keep `/docs` lean by linking to these files when needed instead of duplicating content.

Before adding a file here, confirm it has an owner and a reason to live outside the core docs:

- **Initiative briefs** – customer or market onboarding plans that informed requirements at one point in time (e.g., Blue Buffalo rollout).
- **Completed deep dives** – snapshot reports from the section review program. Active work should stay under `docs/review/**`.
- **Legacy narratives** – business summaries that are useful context but not essential for local development.

When a document becomes active again (e.g., an initiative restarts), move it back into the main `docs/` tree and update `docs/README.md` so teammates can find it.
