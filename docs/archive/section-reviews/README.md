# Archived Section Reviews

Finished deep-dive reports from the MixerAI Section Review program live here. The active workflow still uses `docs/review/{discovery,waiting,working,finished}`, but once a section is fully verified we move its final report into this archive to keep the working folders light.

Each markdown file keeps the original frontmatter and verification notes. If a regression occurs, pull the relevant file back into `docs/review/discovery/` (or start a new one from the template) so the new investigation stays visible to the team.
