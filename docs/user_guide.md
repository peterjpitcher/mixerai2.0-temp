**Website URL**: The primary website for the brand.

**Country & Language**: Helps tailor content to specific regions and languages.

**Brand Identity**: A summary of what the brand stands for, its mission, values, and unique selling propositions.
- *Example*: "We provide sustainable and ethically sourced home goods for environmentally conscious consumers. Our mission is to make green living accessible and stylish."

**Tone of Voice**: Describes the personality and style of the brand's communication.
- *Example*: "Friendly, informative, and slightly witty. Avoid overly technical jargon. Aim for an inspiring and empowering tone."

**Guardrails/Key Messages**: Specific phrases to include or avoid, core messages to emphasize, or topics that are off-limits.
- *Example*: "Always mention our commitment to 100% recyclable packaging. Avoid comparisons with competitor X."

**Target Audience**: A description of the ideal customer or audience segment.
