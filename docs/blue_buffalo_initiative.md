# Blue Buffalo MixerAI Onboarding Initiative

We are bringing the Blue Buffalo teams in the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mexico, Australia, and China onto MixerAI. During onboarding each market will capture its brand guard rails, preferred tone of voice, product facts, ingredient notes, creative briefs, and any structured references needed for activation. MixerAI does not collect or store source documents; instead, D&T help every brand translate those requirements into fields, templates, and approval checkpoints inside the platform.

MixerAI will then orchestrate the end-to-end workflow. It allocates tasks, tracks review status, and uses its AI utilities to suggest channel-ready copy, accessibility alt text, metadata, and locally adapted variants that reflect each marketâ€™s nuances. Because D&T co-design a mandatory approval workflow for every brand, a human reviewer signs off before anything is published or shared externally.

The expected outcome is a consistent, auditable planning and production hub where regional teams can move faster on approvals, stay compliant with brand and regulatory rules, and share aligned campaign materials with their partners.
