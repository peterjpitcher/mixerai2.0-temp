## 1. Why This Guide Exists

### The Rebuild Challenge

This is NOT a greenfield project - it's a rebuild with existing users and data. The biggest risk is making architectural decisions that seem fine initially but become impossible to change later without a complete rewrite.

### Key Risks to Avoid

```yaml
Architecture Lock-in Points:
  Multi-tenancy:
    Risk: Building without RLS, adding it later
    Impact: Complete data model rewrite
    Cost: 3-6 months of rework
    
  Authentication:
    Risk: Custom auth instead of Supabase Auth
    Impact: Security vulnerabilities, migration pain
    Cost: 2-3 months of rework
    
  Data Model:
    Risk: Wrong schema decisions
    Impact: Painful migrations with downtime
    Cost: 1-2 months per major change
    
  AI Integration:
    Risk: No cost tracking from day 1
    Impact: Runaway costs, no optimization data
    Cost: $10k-50k in unexpected bills
```

### Success Criteria

```typescript
interface RebuildSuccess {
  architecture: {
    multiTenancy: 'built-in from day 1',
    security: 'comprehensive from start',
    performance: 'scalable patterns only',
    cost: 'predictable and optimized'
  },
  
  delivery: {
    phase0: 'architecture proven',
    phase1: 'foundation solid',
    phase2: 'patterns validated',
    phase3: 'features complete',
    phase4: 'production ready'
  },
  
  migration: {
    dataIntegrity: '100% preserved',
    downtime: '< 30 minutes',
    rollback: 'possible at any stage',
    userImpact: 'minimal'
  }
}
```

---

## 2. Phase 0: Architecture Validation

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Purpose**: Prove the architecture works before building features  
**Success Gate**: Must pass ALL validations before proceeding

### 2.1 Vertical Slice Implementation

Build ONE complete feature end-to-end to validate all architectural decisions:

```typescript
// Example: Brand Management Vertical Slice

// 1. Database Schema with RLS
CREATE TABLE brands (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- RLS Policies (MUST HAVE)
ALTER TABLE brands ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view brands they have access to"
ON brands FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM brand_users
    WHERE brand_id = brands.id
    AND user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

// 2. API Route with Authentication
export const GET = withAuth(async (req, user) => {
  const supabase = createServerClient()
  
  // RLS automatically filters brands
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('brands')
    .select('*')
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
    
  if (error) throw error
  return NextResponse.json({ data })
})

// 3. Frontend with Proper Data Fetching
export default function BrandsPage() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['brands'],
    queryFn: fetchBrands,
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  })
  
  // Proper loading/error states
  if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />
  if (error) return <ErrorAlert error={error} />
  
  return <BrandsList brands={data} />
}

// 4. Test Multi-Tenancy
test('users can only see their brands', async () => {
  const user1 = await createUser()
  const user2 = await createUser()
  
  const brand1 = await createBrand(user1)
  const brand2 = await createBrand(user2)
  
  // User1 should only see brand1
  const brands = await fetchBrands(user1)
  expect(brands).toHaveLength(1)
  expect(brands[0].id).toBe(brand1.id)
})
```

## 7. Architecture Decision Records

### 7.1 Required ADRs

Document these decisions BEFORE implementation:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Multi-Tenant Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to ensure complete data isolation between organizations while maintaining query performance.

## Decision
Use PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) with organization_id on all tables.

## Consequences
- ‚úÖ Strong security guarantee
- ‚úÖ Works with Supabase
- ‚úÖ Transparent to application code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires careful policy design
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can impact query performance if not indexed properly

## Alternatives Considered
1. Application-level filtering: Rejected - too error-prone
2. Separate databases: Rejected - too complex to manage
3. Schema-per-tenant: Rejected - doesn't scale
```

### 7.2 ADR Topics

Must document decisions for:
- Multi-tenancy approach
- Authentication strategy  
- Caching architecture
- AI provider abstraction
- File storage strategy
- Search implementation
- Analytics approach
- Deployment strategy

## 9. Red Flags & Course Correction

### 9.1 Early Warning Signs

```yaml
Technical Red Flags:
  - "We'll add RLS later": STOP IMMEDIATELY
  - "Let's skip the auth middleware": CRITICAL ERROR
  - "We don't need indexes yet": PERFORMANCE DISASTER
  - "Caching can wait": SCALING NIGHTMARE
  - "We'll track costs later": BUDGET OVERRUN
  
Process Red Flags:
  - Skipping Phase 0: PROJECT FAILURE LIKELY
  - No ADRs written: ARCHITECTURE DRIFT
  - Tests written after: QUALITY ISSUES
  - No code reviews: TECHNICAL DEBT
  - Rushed deployments: PRODUCTION ISSUES
  
Business Red Flags:
  - Feature creep in Phase 1: FOUNDATION WEAKNESS
  - Changing requirements: SCOPE CREEP
  - Skipping checkpoints: RISK ACCUMULATION
  - No user feedback: WRONG PRODUCT
```

### 9.2 Course Correction Protocol

When red flags appear:

1. **STOP** - Don't continue building on shaky foundation
2. **ASSESS** - Determine scope of issue
3. **PLAN** - Create correction plan with timeline
4. **COMMUNICATE** - Inform all stakeholders
5. **EXECUTE** - Fix properly, not with band-aids
6. **VALIDATE** - Ensure issue is fully resolved
7. **DOCUMENT** - Update ADRs and runbooks

---

## 10. Migration Strategy

### 10.1 Data Migration Plan

```yaml
Pre-Migration:
  - Complete Phase 3 minimum
  - Data mapping documented
  - Migration scripts tested
  - Rollback plan ready
  - Users notified
  
Migration Steps:
  1. Enable read-only mode
  2. Export data from old system
  3. Transform data format
  4. Import to new system
  5. Validate data integrity
  6. Test with subset of users
  7. Full cutover
  8. Monitor closely
  
Post-Migration:
  - Keep old system running (1 month)
  - Daily data validation
  - Performance monitoring
  - User feedback collection
  - Issue resolution
```

### 10.2 Risk Mitigation

```typescript
interface MigrationRisks {
  dataLoss: {
    mitigation: 'Multiple backups + validation',
    rollback: '< 1 hour to restore'
  },
  
  downtime: {
    mitigation: 'Read-only mode + staged migration',
    target: '< 30 minutes'
  },
  
  userImpact: {
    mitigation: 'Clear communication + training',
    support: '24/7 during migration'
  },
  
  performance: {
    mitigation: 'Load testing + scaling ready',
    monitoring: 'Real-time dashboards'
  }
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Warning

**DO NOT**:
- Skip Phase 0 to "save time" - you'll pay 10x later
- Build features before authentication works
- Delay RLS implementation - it's not optional
- Ignore performance until "later" - it's exponentially harder
- Assume Vercel/Supabase abstractions handle everything - they don't

**ALWAYS**:
- Test with multiple tenants from day 1
- Track every external API call cost
- Document every architectural decision
- Benchmark performance continuously
- Have a rollback plan for everything
