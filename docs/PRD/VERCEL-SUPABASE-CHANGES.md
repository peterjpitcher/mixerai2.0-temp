# PRD Updates for Vercel and Supabase Architecture

## Overview
This document summarizes the key changes made to the Product Requirements Documentation to reflect the use of Vercel for hosting and Supabase for the database platform, instead of the originally specified Kubernetes/AWS infrastructure.

## Key Architecture Changes

### 1. Hosting Platform: Vercel
- **Serverless Functions** instead of containerized microservices
- **Edge Functions** for middleware and global distribution
- **Automatic scaling** without configuration
- **Built-in CI/CD** through GitHub integration
- **Global CDN** with edge caching

### 2. Database Platform: Supabase
- **Managed PostgreSQL** with automatic backups
- **Built-in Authentication** (replacing custom auth service)
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** for multi-tenancy
- **Realtime subscriptions** via WebSockets
- **Storage buckets** for file management
- **Connection pooling** handled automatically

## Document Updates

### Technical Architecture (04-TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Removed Kubernetes deployment specifications
- Added Vercel deployment strategy with serverless functions
- Updated infrastructure to reflect Vercel Edge Network
- Changed monitoring stack to Vercel Analytics + integrations
- Simplified deployment pipeline for Git-based deployments

### Non-Functional Requirements (10-NON-FUNCTIONAL-REQUIREMENTS.md)
- Updated deployment environment from Kubernetes to Vercel
- Revised operational procedures for serverless architecture
- Adjusted performance expectations for serverless cold starts

### Implementation Roadmap (12-IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md)
- Changed Month 1 infrastructure setup from K8s to Vercel/Supabase
- Significantly reduced infrastructure costs (~$1M savings)
- Updated skill requirements (less DevOps, more Next.js focus)

### Security & Compliance (08-SECURITY-COMPLIANCE.md)
- Replaced container security with serverless function security
- Updated to use Vercel's built-in DDoS and edge protection
- Changed secrets management to Vercel environment variables
- Leveraged Supabase's built-in security features

### Data Model (05-DATA-MODEL-SCHEMA.md)
- Updated to show Supabase-specific features
- Included Supabase Auth in the architecture
- Changed caching strategy to use Vercel KV
- Updated encryption to use Supabase Vault

## Cost Implications

### Original Budget (Kubernetes/AWS)
- Infrastructure: $600,000/year
- Total Project: $8,635,000

### Updated Budget (Vercel/Supabase)
- Infrastructure: $150,800/year
- Total Project: $7,530,800
- **Savings: ~$1.1M (13%)**

## Technical Benefits

1. **Simplified Operations**
   - No Kubernetes cluster management
   - Automatic scaling and load balancing
   - Built-in monitoring and analytics

2. **Faster Development**
   - Instant preview deployments
   - Integrated CI/CD
   - Less infrastructure code

3. **Better Performance**
   - Global edge network
   - Automatic optimizations
   - Smart caching strategies

4. **Enhanced Security**
   - Automatic SSL/TLS
   - DDoS protection included
   - Simplified secrets management

## Tradeoffs

1. **Less Control**
   - Cannot customize infrastructure deeply
   - Vendor lock-in to Vercel/Supabase
   - Limited to supported runtimes

2. **Different Scaling Model**
   - Serverless cold starts
   - Function timeout limits (60s max)
   - Connection pooling considerations

3. **Cost Model**
   - Pay-per-use can be unpredictable
   - Bandwidth costs at scale
   - Function execution charges

## Migration Considerations

The architecture remains API-compatible, so the functional requirements and user experience remain unchanged. The main differences are in:

- Deployment procedures
- Environment configuration
- Monitoring and debugging
- Performance optimization techniques

## Conclusion

Using Vercel and Supabase significantly simplifies the infrastructure while maintaining all required functionality. The cost savings and operational simplicity make this an attractive alternative to the original Kubernetes-based architecture, especially for a SaaS application like MixerAI.
