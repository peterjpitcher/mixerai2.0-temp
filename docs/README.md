# MixerAI 2.0 Documentation

This folder now focuses on the documents teams rely on every day. Each note is short, task-oriented, and links directly to the code paths that implement it.

| Topic | Why it matters | File |
|-------|----------------|------|
| Product snapshot | What MixerAI does and which personas it serves | [overview.md](./overview.md) |
| System architecture | How Next.js, Supabase, and Azure OpenAI fit together | [architecture.md](./architecture.md) |
| Frontend | App Router layout, UI patterns, shared hooks/providers | [frontend.md](./frontend.md) |
| Backend & APIs | Authentication wrappers, request flow, external integrations | [backend.md](./backend.md) |
| Data & Supabase | Core tables, migrations, and RPC strategy | [data.md](./data.md) |
| Development workflow | Local setup, required env vars, useful scripts | [development.md](./development.md) |
| Testing | Current coverage, commands, and known gaps | [testing.md](./testing.md) |
| Feature guide | Where to find code for brands, templates, content, workflows, and tools | [features.md](./features.md) |

## Archival Policy

- Customer briefs, completed section reviews, and other long-form narratives now live under [`docs/archive`](./archive/README.md).
- When a document stops being part of the day-to-day workflows, move it into the archive instead of keeping it alongside the core references.
- If an archived topic becomes active again, pull it back into this folder and update this index so teammates know where to look.

**Need something that is missing?** Keep the docs lean—open a PR that either updates one of the focused pages above or adds a new one with a clear owner.
