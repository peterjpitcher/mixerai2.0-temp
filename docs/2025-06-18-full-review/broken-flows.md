# Broken User Flows - Critical Issues

**Date**: December 2024  
**Severity**: High  
**Action Required**: Immediate fixes needed

## Summary

This document identifies user flows that are currently broken or severely impaired in the MixerAI 2.0 application. These issues prevent users from completing essential tasks and require immediate attention.

## Critical Broken Flows

### 1. ðŸ”´ Password Reset Completion

**Flow**: Forgot Password â†’ Reset Email â†’ Update Password â†’ **[BROKEN]**

**Issue**: After successfully resetting their password, users are left on a blank `/auth/update-password` page with no indication of success or next steps.

**Impact**: 
- Users don't know if password was changed
- Can't find their way back to login
- May attempt multiple resets
- Increased support tickets

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// In /src/app/auth/update-password/page.tsx
if (form.formState.isSubmitSuccessful) {
  // No redirect or success message implemented
  return null; // This leaves users stranded
}
```

**Fix Required**:
```typescript
router.push('/auth/login?message=password-reset-success');
```

### 2. ðŸ”´ Non-Admin Brand Creation Redirect

**Flow**: Create Brand â†’ Save â†’ **[BROKEN]**

**Issue**: After creating a brand, non-admin users are redirected to the brand detail page they don't have permission to access, resulting in an error.

**Impact**:
- Confusing error after successful action
- Users think brand creation failed
- Must manually navigate back

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// In /src/app/api/brands/route.ts
// Always redirects to brand detail regardless of user permissions
return NextResponse.json({ 
  success: true, 
  data: brand,
  redirect: `/dashboard/brands/${brand.id}` // Fails for non-admins
});
```

### 3. ðŸ”´ Workflow Without Assignees

**Flow**: Create Workflow â†’ Add Steps â†’ Save Without Assignees â†’ **[BROKEN]**

**Issue**: Workflows can be created without assignees despite being required, creating non-functional workflows that can't process content.

**Impact**:
- Content gets stuck in workflows
- No notifications sent
- Workflows appear broken
- Data integrity compromised

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// In /src/app/api/workflows/route.ts
// No validation for assignees
const workflow = await createWorkflow(data); // Missing validation
```

### 4. ðŸ”´ Session Timeout During Form Completion

**Flow**: Long Form â†’ Session Expires â†’ Submit â†’ **[BROKEN]**

**Issue**: When sessions expire during form completion (especially content generation), submission fails and all data is lost.

**Impact**:
- Hours of work lost
- User frustration
- Decreased trust in platform
- Abandoned content creation

**Evidence**:
- No form auto-save mechanism
- No session expiry warnings
- No data recovery options

### 5. ðŸ”´ AI Generation Failure Dead End

**Flow**: Generate Content â†’ AI Error â†’ **[BROKEN]**

**Issue**: When AI generation fails, users see an error with no recovery options and must start over.

**Impact**:
- Complete loss of form data
- No way to retry
- Users abandon task
- Poor experience with core feature

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// In /src/components/content/ContentGeneratorForm.tsx
catch (error) {
  toast.error('Generation failed'); // No retry option
  // Form data is lost
}
```

## Severely Impaired Flows

### 6. ðŸŸ¡ Brand Permission Flash

**Flow**: Navigate to Brand Page â†’ **[IMPAIRED]** â†’ Access Denied

**Issue**: Unauthorized content briefly displays before permission check redirects user.

**Security Impact**:
- Sensitive data exposure
- Compliance risk
- Trust issues

### 7. ðŸŸ¡ Invitation Without Expiry

**Flow**: Send User Invitation â†’ **[IMPAIRED]** â†’ Never Expires

**Issue**: Invitations remain valid indefinitely, creating security risk.

**Security Impact**:
- Unauthorized access risk
- No way to revoke invitations
- Audit trail compromised

### 8. ðŸŸ¡ Missing Upload Validation

**Flow**: Upload Logo â†’ Large File â†’ **[IMPAIRED]** â†’ Server Error

**Issue**: No client-side validation for file uploads causes server errors.

**Impact**:
- Poor error messages
- Server resource waste
- Confused users

## Quick Fix Priority

### Immediate (Today)
1. Password reset redirect
2. AI generation retry button
3. Workflow assignee validation

### This Week
4. Brand creation redirect logic
5. Form data persistence
6. Session expiry warning

### This Month
7. Permission check timing
8. Invitation expiry system
9. Upload validation

## Testing Checklist

After implementing fixes, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Complete password reset flow end-to-end
- [ ] Create brand as non-admin user
- [ ] Create workflow and verify assignee requirement
- [ ] Fill long form, wait for session timeout
- [ ] Trigger AI generation failure and retry
- [ ] Access unauthorized brand page
- [ ] Send and track user invitation
- [ ] Upload oversized logo file

## Code Locations

Critical files requiring immediate fixes:

1. `/src/app/auth/update-password/page.tsx` - Add redirect
2. `/src/app/api/brands/route.ts` - Fix permission-aware redirect
3. `/src/app/api/workflows/route.ts` - Add assignee validation
4. `/src/components/content/ContentGeneratorForm.tsx` - Add retry mechanism
5. `/src/hooks/useFormPersistence.ts` - Create this for form saving
6. `/src/middleware.ts` - Add session expiry warning

## Monitoring

Set up alerts for:
- Password reset completion rate < 80%
- Workflow creation errors
- AI generation failure rate > 10%
- 403 errors after successful actions
- Form submission failures

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues:
1. Add E2E tests for critical flows
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Add analytics for flow completion
4. Regular flow testing in staging
5. User feedback integration

These broken flows represent critical failures in core user journeys. Fixing them should be the highest priority to ensure basic platform functionality.
