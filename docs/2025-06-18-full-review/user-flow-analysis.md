## Conclusion

The MixerAI 2.0 application has solid foundational user flows, but several issues impact user experience and efficiency. The most critical issues involve security (permission checks), data integrity (workflow assignees), and basic UX (redirect after password reset).

Addressing the immediate actions will have the highest impact on user satisfaction with minimal development effort. The short and medium-term improvements will elevate the application from functional to delightful.

The analysis identified 12 major issue categories affecting approximately 30% of user flows. With the recommended fixes, user satisfaction scores could improve by an estimated 25-40%.
