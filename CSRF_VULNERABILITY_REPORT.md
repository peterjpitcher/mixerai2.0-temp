# CSRF Vulnerability Report

## Summary

Found **13 API routes** with mutation methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) that lack proper CSRF protection. These routes are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Routes with NO Authentication (Most Critical)

These routes have mutation methods but no authentication at all, making them vulnerable to both CSRF and unauthorized access:

1. **`/api/auth/cleanup-sessions/route.ts`**
   - Method: POST
   - Current Protection: Basic Bearer token check (not CSRF-safe)
   - Risk: High - Session manipulation possible

2. **`/api/catch-all-error/[...path]/route.ts`**
   - Methods: POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
   - Current Protection: None (404 handler)
   - Risk: Low - Just returns 404 errors

### 2. Routes with Only `withCSRF` (No Authentication)

These routes have CSRF protection but no authentication, meaning anyone can call them:

3. **`/api/ai/generate-step-description/route.ts`**
   - Method: POST
   - Current Protection: `withCSRF` only
   - Risk: Medium - AI resource consumption without auth

4. **`/api/ai/generate-template-description/route.ts`**
   - Method: POST
   - Current Protection: `withCSRF` only
   - Risk: Medium - AI resource consumption without auth

5. **`/api/ai/generate-workflow-description/route.ts`**
   - Method: POST
   - Current Protection: `withCSRF` only
   - Risk: Medium - AI resource consumption without auth

6. **`/api/errors/track/route.ts`**
   - Method: POST
   - Current Protection: `withCSRF` only
   - Risk: Low - Error tracking endpoint

7. **`/api/notifications/clear/route.ts`**
   - Method: DELETE
   - Current Protection: `withCSRF` only
   - Risk: High - Can clear notifications without auth

8. **`/api/notifications/email/route.ts`**
   - Method: POST
   - Current Protection: `withCSRF` only
   - Risk: High - Can send emails without auth

9. **`/api/notifications/mark-read/route.ts`**
   - Method: PUT
   - Current Protection: `withCSRF` only
   - Risk: High - Can mark notifications as read without auth

10. **`/api/user/notification-settings/route.ts`**
    - Methods: POST, PATCH
    - Current Protection: `withCSRF` only
    - Risk: High - Can modify user settings without auth

11. **`/api/users/resend-invite/route.ts`**
    - Method: POST
    - Current Protection: `withCSRF` only
    - Risk: High - Can trigger invite emails without auth

### 3. Routes with `withAdminAuth` but No CSRF Protection

These routes have admin authentication but lack CSRF protection:

12. **`/api/test-azure-openai/route.ts`**
    - Method: POST
    - Current Protection: `withAdminAuth` only
    - Risk: Medium - Admin-only test endpoint vulnerable to CSRF

13. **`/api/test-metadata-generator/route.ts`**
    - Method: POST
    - Current Protection: `withAdminAuth` only
    - Risk: Medium - Admin-only test endpoint vulnerable to CSRF

14. **`/api/test-template-generation/route.ts`**
    - Method: POST
    - Current Protection: `withAdminAuth` only
    - Risk: Medium - Admin-only test endpoint vulnerable to CSRF

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Critical Routes** - Add authentication to routes that currently only have CSRF:
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   export const POST = withCSRF(async function (request: NextRequest) {
   
   // To:
   export const POST = withAuthAndCSRF(async function (request: NextRequest, user: User) {
   ```

2. **Admin Routes** - Update admin routes to use CSRF protection:
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   export const POST = withAdminAuth(async (req: NextRequest, _user) => {
   
   // To:
   export const POST = withAdminAuthAndCSRF(async (req: NextRequest, _user) => {
   ```

3. **Special Cases**:
   - `/api/auth/cleanup-sessions` - Should use a more secure method (cron job secret, internal network only)
   - `/api/catch-all-error` - Can remain as-is (just a 404 handler)
   - `/api/errors/track` - May need to remain public but rate-limited

### Security Best Practices

1. **Always use the combined wrappers** for mutation endpoints:
   - `withAuthAndCSRF` - For authenticated users
   - `withAdminAuthAndCSRF` - For admin-only endpoints
   - `withRouteAuthAndCSRF` - For route-specific auth
   - `withAuthMonitoringAndCSRF` - For monitored endpoints

2. **Never use** these alone for mutation methods:
   - `withAuth` - No CSRF protection
   - `withAdminAuth` - No CSRF protection
   - `withCSRF` - No authentication

3. **GET requests** don't need CSRF protection (they're safe from CSRF by design)

## File Locations

All vulnerable files are located in: `/Users/peterpitcher/Cursor/MixerAI2.0/src/app/api/`

## Next Steps

1. Review each vulnerable endpoint to determine proper protection level
2. Update endpoints to use appropriate authentication + CSRF wrappers
3. Test all updated endpoints to ensure they still function correctly
4. Consider adding automated checks to prevent future CSRF vulnerabilities
